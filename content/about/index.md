Welcome to **nenjo.trades** â€” a space where market analysis takes center stage, backed by the precision of software engineering.

Iâ€™m Nenjo, a trader with a strong engineering mindset. My background spans over 13 years in software development, but today, my focus is on reading the markets, understanding price movements, and turning those insights into actionable strategies.

This blog is where I document market observations, share trading setups, and explain the reasoning behind each trade idea. Youâ€™ll also find occasional posts on how I use automation to reduce human error and improve consistency, using tools like **Go, Python, PineScript, Expert Advisor,** and **MetaTrader**.

I help traders turn their strategies into fully automated bots using Expert Advisors, Python, or Go.

If youâ€™re ready to bring your idea to life, Iâ€™d be happy to help.
